# AidImpactTraining
A simple blog system created to improve my ASP.NET Core MVC knowledge and to prepare myself for the AidImpact technical challenge.

# Steps to follow
Here are the 5 easy steps to make the web application work :
  1)  Download or clone the repository into your computer
  2)  It will download the zip folder "AidImpactTraining-master.zip"
  3)  Once it is installed on your pc, right-click on the zip folder and choose "Extract here"
  4)  Open the folder and double-click on the solution which has the name "AidImpactTraining.sln"
  5)  Now that Visual Studio is open, the last step is to click on the button "IIS Express"

Finally, you'll see the web application open itself into a new web window!

# Main featyres
Here are some of the main functionnalities:
  - Registration, login and logout system
  - Blog system in which you can add blog posts only when you're connected
  - Blog posts with paging system
  - Responsive design to make it easier for you!

For the security, I use the Microsoft "Identity Services" which means that your password is invisible (crypted for the developers out there).

# Conclusion
In conclusion, this project helped me to improve my knowledge with Microsoft development tools but also showed how easy it can be to create a complete "Identity Service" to secure the user connection.
